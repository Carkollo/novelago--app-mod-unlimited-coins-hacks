NovelaGo app Mod unlimited coins unlock chapters free HACKS - Defenders are bulky tanks that can often mock enemies or provide direct defense or damage reduction gains for teammates. They are usually best placed at the front, as artificial intelligence always targets the front unit first, although you don't have to do so unless the enemy pulls out the Taunt. The defender gains AP while hitting the ball, which works well with the healer as they also gain AP from every tooth lost by the defender or anyone else in battle. They may not necessarily be weak in damage handling, but their resilience is the real advantage. How to get 100K coins in NovelaGo now
